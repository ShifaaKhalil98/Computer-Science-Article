            <strong>Computer science</strong> is the study of computers and their theoretical and practical applications.<br />
            <strong>Computer science</strong> applies the principles of mathematics, engineering, and logic, including algorithm formulation, software and hardware development, and artificial intelligence. It also includes graphics, visualization, image processing and sound processing.

            A <strong>data structure</strong> is a specialized format for organizing, processing, retrieving and storing data. There are several types of data structures, used to arrange data to according to each purpose.<br />
            <strong>Some data structures:</strong></p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>List</em>: a linear collection of data elements of any type, called nodes, where each node has itself a value, and points to the next node in the linked list.

                <li>
                    <em>Array</em>: a collection of elements in a specific order, typically all of the same type and can be accessed using an index.

                    <em>Graph</em>: a non-linear data structure thst is represented as a set of nodes or vertices connected (or not) by edges. "The set of edges can be empty".

                    <em>Tree</em>: a nonlinear data structure. It is defined as a graph that is connected and doesn't contain cycles. "A tree can be empty".<br />
                    A <em>binary tree</em> is a type of a tree where it has 2 children at most.<br />
                    A <em>Binary Search Tree (BST)</em> is a binary tree where one of the children is bigger and the other one is smaller than the root and the key is consistency. "The root is a chosen vertex".

            Programming languages are a part of computer science. To use a computer, the programmer translates commands into a specific programming language the computer can read.<br />
            <strong>Some programming languages in order of importance:</strong>
            <ol>
              <li>JAVASCRIPT: is the most commonly-used language.</li>
              <li>HTML/CSS</li>
              <li>SQL</li>
              <li>PYTHON: is the easiest programming language to learn.</li>
              <li>JAVA</li>
              <li>C++</li>
              <li>C#</li>
